First configure your local MySQL server. Make root user's password empty or change password from blazeds-flex-server/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml.

In order to build and run this code you need Apache-Maven.

In order to build code run this command

> mvn clean install

Then there will be a war file under blazeds-flex-server/target/ directory. Take this war file and deploy to any servlet container like Apache Tomcat. 

Enjoy!
